## Tiny CMS

Main goal of this project is to create a simple and easy to use CMS for small websites. It is not meant to be a full featured CMS like WordPress or Joomla, but rather a simple tool to manage a small website.
You should be able to write your pages in markdown and upload them to the server. The CMS will take care of the rest.
